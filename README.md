# lopb-eclipse-plugin


This is a fork of [Lack of Progress Bar plugin for Eclipse](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lopb/). 

Currently, it has no difference in the functionality. The fork makes it running on Eclipse 4.x, add an automated build and publish a [Eclipse Update Site(https://github.com/lopb-eclipse-plugin/eclipse-update-site) on Github.
