		<para>Lack of Progress Bar (Lopb) is a performance benchmarking tool for your
			software development environment. Lopb can be used to monitor and optimize the
			performance of tools and infrastructure that developers access through their
			Eclipse-based IDE.</para>
		
		<para>To install Lopb in your Eclipse environment, see Installation. To read about
			how Lopb works, see the section on Concepts. For a description of Lopb Features,
			see the Lopb Features section. For examples of the types of reports that can be
			produced with the data provided by Lopb, see the Reporting Cookbook section.
			Finally, for answers to frequently asked questions, please refer to the
			FAQ.</para>
		
		<para>If you have any questions about Lopb or are interested in contributing to the
			project, please send us an email at support@lopb.org.</para>

		<title>Concepts</title>
		
		<para>The following paragraphs explain some of the Eclipse functionality that Lopb
			relies on to gather benchmarking information.</para>
		
		<sect1 id="jobsJobManagerJobChangeListener">
			
			<title>Jobs, JobManager, JobChangeListener</title>
			
			<para>Since Eclipse version 3.0, plug-in developers are strongly encouraged
				to implement long-running activities as an Eclipse background Jobs <ulink
					url="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Concurrency/jobs-api.html">
				[1]</ulink> . For example, checking a file out of a source code repository,
				building from an ant script, and publishing an app to an application server
				should be implemented as Eclipse background Jobs by plug-in
				developers.</para>
			
			<para>Jobs get scheduled to run by the JobManager. The JobManager provides a
				callback mechanism so that classes implementing IJobChangeListener will
				be notified when jobs are scheduled, when they complete, or otherwise
				change execution status. The events are instances of
				IJobChangeEvent.</para>
			
			<para>By using this mechanism, Lopb listens for all job change events and when
				they occur, it records the job identifier, a timestamp, and other job data
				which is later used to compute various performance metrics. The overhead
				introduced by Lopb is negligible.</para>
			
		</sect1>
		
		<sect1 id="jobIdsRuns">
			
			<title>JobIds and Runs</title>
			
			<para>When IJobChangeEvents are received by Lopb, a JobId is computed from the
				Job's class and name. We have noticed that plug-in developers often provide
				a short description of the job's behavior instead of a name, and this is
				supported by Lopb. We assume that the class and name pair forms a unique
				identifier for a job, and in practice so far, this assumption has held true.
				Every time a job runs, Lopb keeps track of start and end time along with JobId.
				When a job ends, Lopb determines average execution time for all runs of the
				given JobId, in addition to some other metrics. This data is presented in the
				Lopb Report View.</para>
			
		</sect1>
		
		<sect1 id="concurrectJobsRules">
			
			<title>Concurrent Jobs and Scheduling Rules</title>
			
			<para>Jobs can run concurrently, and may indeed contend for shared resources
				(e.g. workspace files). In order to guard against resource corruption or
				deadlock, scheduling rules are used. At this time, Lopb is not concerned
				with concurrency or scheduling rules since only individual job runs are
				monitored, and not dependencies between jobs or the locks or files that they
				contend for. This may change in the future in order to produce aggregate or
				&quot;roll-up&quot; metrics, see Lopb Status indicator
				(experimental).</para>

			<para>The Lopb Status Indicator is still an experimental feature. It shows an

				before and after a change like a RAM upgrade or system

			<para>The Lopb Status Indicator is eventually going to be the "lack of progress
				bar", so the more time developers wait for jobs to complete (by staring at a
				progress bar), the higher the "lack of progress" metric will rise, and vice

				Then, after an upgrade to the source code repository server, data was
				collected again over the course of a second week. Finally, by plotting the
				average time it took to check in a file for each of the week, the following

			<qandaentry>
				<question>
					<para>Does it slow down my IDE?</para>
				</question>
				<answer>
					<para>The overhead introduced by Lopb is negligible. We were careful
						to not do any time-consuming processing in the JobManager of
						IJobChangeListener callback handlers. We donâ€™t yet have a factor
						for the overhead, but through a lot of experimentation, we have
						seen that it is very small.</para>
				</answer>
			</qandaentry>
			<qandaentry>
				<question>
					<para>Is it free?</para>
				</question>
				<answer>
					<para>Yes. Lopb is released under the terms of the Eclipse Public
						License, version 1.0 and your are free to download and use the
						software. For further details on what you can or cannot do, please
						read http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html. Note that
